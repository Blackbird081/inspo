/**
 * Runtime catalogue loader for environments that can't bundle the seed
 * (the Cloudflare Worker) — and, optionally, the npx/local MCP if you'd
 * rather ship a tiny package than inline 16MB.
 *
 * Fetches the three catalogue files published by
 * `apps/worker/src/publish-catalogue-to-blob.ts` and injects them into
 * the query + vector layers:
 *
 *   <base>/static-screens.json  → setCatalogue()   (required)
 *   <base>/embeddings.idx.json  → setSidecar()      (optional — vectors)
 *   <base>/embeddings.bin       ↗
 *
 * `fetch` is available in both the Workers runtime and modern Node, so
 * this module is runtime-agnostic. Vectors are best-effort: if the
 * sidecar is missing/mismatched the catalogue still loads and vector
 * tools degrade to lexical search.

 * The two sidecars load SEPARATELY. The per-site one (embeddings.*,
 * 3.3MB) powers search_screens' vector blend, so hosted routes await it
 * before serving. The per-row one (embeddings-rows.*, 9.1MB) is read
 * only by find_similar — loading it eagerly cost every
 * lambda +9.1MB and blocked even initialize/tools-list on the bigger
